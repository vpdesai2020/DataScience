Creating SQLite database named as Friends_DB
```{r}
library(DBI)
db = dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = "Friends_DB.sqlite")
```

 1. Create a table named friends with three columns:
      id that stores INTEGER
      name that stores TEXT
      birthday that stores DATE */
```{sql, connection=db}
CREATE TABLE friends (id, name, birthday);
/*The 'CREATE TABLE' statement is used to create a new table in the database: */
```

2. Beneath your current code, add John burg to friends.
    His birthday is May 30th, 1990.
```{sql, connection=db}
INSERT INTO friends (id, name, birthday) 
VALUES (1, 'John burg', '1990-05-30');

/*The INSERT INTO statement is used to insert new records into a table: */
```

3. Let’s make sure that Jane has been added to the database:
```{sql, connection=db}
SELECT * 
FROM friends;
```

4. Let’s move on!
    Add two of your friends to the table.
    Insert an id, name, and birthday for each of them.
```{sql, connection=db}    
INSERT INTO friends (id, name, birthday) 
VALUES (2, 'RajaMouli', '1973-10-10');
```
```{sql, connection=db}
INSERT INTO friends (id, name, birthday) 
VALUES (3, 'vasanth', '1993-12-13');
```
5. Update John burg last name with “Smith”.
    Update her record in friends.
```{sql, connection=db}
UPDATE friends
SET name = 'John Smith'
WHERE id = 1;
/* The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table: */
```
6. Add a new column named email.
```{sql, connection=db}
ALTER TABLE friends 
ADD COLUMN email TEXT; 
/* The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table: */
```
7. Update the email address for everyone in your table.
```{sql, connection=db}
UPDATE friends
SET email = 'john@smith.com'
WHERE id = 1;
```
```{sql, connection=db}
UPDATE friends
SET email = 'ssmouli@bb2.com'
WHERE id = 2;
```
```{sql, connection=db}
UPDATE friends
SET email = 'vpd@ymail.com'
WHERE id = 3;
```
8. Lets remove John smith from friends.
```{sql, connection=db}
DELETE FROM friends
WHERE id = 1;
```
9. Show all data in the table
```{sql, connection=db}
SELECT * 
FROM friends;
```
